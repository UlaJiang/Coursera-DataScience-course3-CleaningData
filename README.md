#Getting and Cleaning Data --- Coursera Project

##information about all the files:
###1. A R script named r"un_analysis.R" to collect, work with, and clean a dataset. Detailed functionalities and steps are listed below:
1). Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2). Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3). Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4). Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5). From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###2. Two tidy data named "finalTotalTidyData.csv" and "finalMeanTidyData.csv".
1). "finalTotalTidyData.csv" combined all the train data and test data, and shows the measurements only on the mean and standard deviation for each observation.
2). "finalMeanTidyData.csv" shows the information about the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###3. A codebook named "codebook.md" 
"codebook.md" describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
